Implement the target function according to its docstring and function signature.
Ensure coding style of the generated code is consistent with the style of the given code context.
Only output the generated function(including function head and function body), without any extra text or explanations.
Note: Generate the target function with indentation matching its placement in the surrounding context.

The signature and docstring of the target function:
	/**
	 * Reads a line of bytes from the given InputStream.
	 * 
	 * This method reads bytes from the input stream until it encounters a
	 * carriage return (CR, '\r') or line feed (LF, '\n') character, or
	 * the end of the stream. The line terminator itself is not included
	 * in the returned byte array.
	 * 
	 * @param in the InputStream to read from
	 * @return a byte array containing the line read (excluding CR/LF), or null if end-of-stream is reached before any data
	 * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs while reading from the stream
	 */
	public static byte[] readLine(InputStream in) throws IOException

The code context is as follows:
